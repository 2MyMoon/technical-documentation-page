      <p><strong>Prototype</strong> (stylized as [PROTOTYPE]) is a 2009 action-adventure video game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Activision. It was released in June 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows. In July 2015, the game was re-released alongside its sequel as the Prototype Biohazard Bundle for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Separate versions of the two games became available in August 2015.[1] In Prototype, players control an amnesiac shapeshifter named Alex Mercer as he attempts to stop an outbreak of a virus called Blacklight in Manhattan, which mutates individuals into powerful, violent monsters. Alex also attempts to uncover his mysterious past while coming into conflict with both the US military and a black operations force called Blackwatch. Outside of the main story, players can freely explore the game's open world and engage in several different side activities.</p>
      <p>The game was well received by critics following its release, gaining praise for its originality, storytelling, and engaging gameplay, while being criticized for its control scheme and scenery. Several reviewers compared and contrasted it with Infamous, a game released one month prior which had many elements similar to Prototype. It was also a commercial success, selling 2.1 million copies by March 2012. A tie-in comic book miniseries, which serves as a prequel to the events of the game, was published by DC Comics. A sequel, Prototype 2, was released in April 2012.</p>

      <p>Prototype is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective and set in an open world based on modern-day Manhattan. The game's setting remains mostly faithful to the real city and includes all of its famous landmarks, including the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, 40 Wall Street, 28 Liberty Street, the Conde Nast Building, the Metlife Building, One New York Plaza, and the New York Life Building, among others.</p>
      <p>The player character, Alex Mercer, has the ability to shapeshift, allowing him to change his body to resemble anyone. His powers also play into the game's combat system, as Alex can "consume" others to regain health, absorbing their biomass entirely. This also allows him to take on the forms of the human enemies he absorbs, thereby allowing the player to move about the enemy as one of them. The disguise will only last as long as Alex remains inconspicuous. Alex also possesses superhuman strength, and will kill most humans with a single punch. He can perform various melee attacks without shapeshifting, as well as more gymnastic moves such as air combos, sliding along the ground using any humanoid enemy's body, and a high-speed rolling cannonball attack.</p>

      <p>The game's protagonist is Alexander J. "Alex" Mercer (voiced by Barry Pepper), a shapeshifter suffering from amnesia, causing him to forget his previous life, including how he obtained his powers. As he attempts to uncover his past and stop an outbreak of a virus called Blacklight, which has overrun Manhattan, Alex comes into conflict with two factions: the United States Marine Corps and Blackwatch, a Fort Detrick special forces unit dedicated to combating biological warfare; and the Infected, people infected by the Blacklight virus, which turns them into violent monsters. The main antagonist is Robert Cross (Jeff Pierce), also known by his codename, "The Specialist", a Blackwatch officer tasked with containing Alex.</p>
      <p>Supporting characters include Alex's sister Dana Mercer (Lake Bell); Dr. Bradley Ragland (Phil LaMarr), who helps Alex throughout the game; Alex's ex-girlfriend Karen Parker (Vanessa Marshall); Dr. Raymond McMullen (Paul Guilfoyle), founder and head researcher of bio-research company Gentek; General Peter Randall (Gordon Clapp), the head of Blackwatch; Randall's second-in-command, Ian Taggart (Richard McGonagle); and Elizabeth Greene (Kari Wahlgren), also known as "The Mother", a former test subject that hosts the Blacklight virus. Brian Bloom has a minor role as a Blackwatch commander whose appearance Alex assumes at one point. Additional characters are voiced by Dave Fennoy, Dave Wittenberg, David Andriole, David Lodge, and Diane Hsu.</p>

      <p>The game received "generally favorable reviews" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.[36][37][38] Prototype was released on Steam as well as in retail stores and topped the Steam sales on the week of its release.[39] The Xbox 360 version of Prototype was the top selling game of June 2009 in North America, with over 419,900 units sold.[40] This made the game a Platinum Hit. As of March 2012, the game had sold 2.1 million copies worldwide.[41]</p>
      <p>GameSpot praised the game for its "intriguing storyline and protagonist" and "massive arsenal of moves and abilities", but criticized it for its "occasionally fiddly controls" and "dull scenery".[20][19] The Escapist said the Xbox 360 version was a perfect "summer fling," praising the combat and movement systems as well as the unique mechanic of the Web of Intrigue.[42] The A.V. Club gave the same console version an "Aâˆ’" ranking, calling the movement style "exhilarating" and saying it was a "mature, science-fiction superhero fantasy that somehow makes players feel simultaneously powerful and vulnerable."[34] 411Mania gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it "an entirely different type of sandbox game that will attract and please most gamers."[43] The Daily Telegraph gave it a similar score of eight out of ten and said it "offers an action-filled experience that few games can match, and the array of attacks on offer is almost unparalleled in both its variety and its easy accessibility. The pure adrenaline-boosting entertainment value of the finished product is enough to push most visual and gameplay niggles far enough into the background so as to eradicate them as concerns in all but the most snobbish of gamers."[35] Edge also gave it a score of eight out of ten, saying that the game "does what it does, and does it with distinction."[44] However, Teletext GameCentral gave it five out of ten, concluding, "The initial feelings of power and freedom hide another badly designed and unimaginative superhero sim."[45] Though never received official copy in Japan, Famitsu praise the gameplay and visual effects.[46]</p>

      <p>The game was announced by Vivendi Games subsidiary Sierra Entertainment on August 10, 2007, revealing it would release for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in the summer of 2008.[2] The company revealed more information about the title over the upcoming months, including support for THX's neural 7.1 surround sound, being the first video game to support it,[3] and the reveal of the voice cast in February.[4] On April 8, 2008, Sierra announced the opening of the game's official website .[5] On May 5, 2008, Sierra and Radical announced that the game would be pushed back to 2009.[6]</p>
      <p>On July 28, 2008, after the merger of Activision and Vivendi Games to form Activision Blizzard, the company announced that they would only publish five Sierra titles, with Prototype being one of the five titles retained alongside fellow Radical Entertainment title Crash: Mind Over Mutant. On August 14, 2008, Radical laid off some of their staff, which led to a fear that the game would be delayed again.[7]</p>
